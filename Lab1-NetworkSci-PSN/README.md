# Lab 1: Network science and Patient Similarity Networks (PSN)

This lab will give a quick example-based introduction to basic ideas in **graph theory**, **network science**, and the concept of **patient similarity networks** (PSN) using *NetworkX* - a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

### Your turn! 

Spend some time playing around with the provided examples. You'll find some questions for you to investigate in the notebook. If you're already familiar with graphs and networks, you can try your hand at more advanced examples or, even better, help out other less experienced team members.
