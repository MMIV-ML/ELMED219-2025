# ELMED219/BMED365: AI in healthcare innovation project

## Overview
Welcome to the course project for ELMED219! The goal for this project is to explore the intersection of AI and healthcare either through deep research or hands on innovation. In groups, you will investigate how AI, and in particular large language models (LLMs), could revolutionize medical practice and healthcare more broadly.

## Project tracks

The course offers two paths for exploring AI in healthcare. 

### Research track
In the Research Track you will conduct an in-depth analysis of how AI can be used to tackle particular healthcare challenges. You will use AI tools throughout the research process and develop a comprehensive understanding of your chosen topic.

Key elements:
* Thorough investigation of current developments and state-of-the-art
* Critical analysis of potential impacts and obstacles to implementation
* Extensive use of AI tools in research, analysis, and writing
* Final report demonstrating scholarly rigor and insight
* Research presentation focusing on:

   * Methodology and findings
   * Critical analysis and implications
   * Recommendations for implementation
   * Future research directions

### Innovation track
The innovation track will be a hands-on effort to create a prototype proof of concept (PoC). You will make a working product while experiencing the unique value of AI in accelerating healthcare innovation.

Key elements:

* Development of a working prototype
* Creation of a business case
* Use of AI tools throughout development, from ideation to implementation
* Final report documenting technical and business aspects
* Startup pitch presentation including:
   * Problem and solution demonstration
   * Market analysis and value proposition
   * Business model and growth strategy
   * Live prototype demonstration
   * Future development roadmap

This track is best for students eager to experience the entire process of innovation from idea to implementation and learn how AI can accelerate healthcare entrepreneurship.

## Group formation
 Students will be working in groups of 3+. You will team up with peers with perspectives and skills different from your own. We encourage you to assemble diverse teams with different backgrounds as this will be ultimately more enriching for the project. While a technical background is helpful, it is not a requirement. We balance teams to ensure that students with programming experience are distributed evenly across groups.

## Project ideas
 Your project can focus on any healthcare problem that could benefit from AI. Some promising areas include patient education materials generation, medical report simplification, diagnostic support systems, and clinical workflow optimization. 
 
 You can think of creative healthcare problems you have encountered or observed. The course materials provide detailed examples of potential projects, but you are welcome to propose your own ideas within the project framework.

## Deliverables
All groups must produce a final report documenting your work. If you are in the research track, your group will provide a detailed report on the AI application, the potential impact, and implementation considerations. If you are in the innovation track, you must provide a prototype and pitch your business case to a panel of academic experts and other potential stakeholders. Both tracks should consider and demonstrate ethical considerations and thoughtful use of AI tools.

## Possible project ideas
Here are some ideas for inspiration, but students are free to choose their projects within the given framework:

1. **Medical FAQ generator**  
   Build a tool that transforms standard medical FAQs into language tailored for patients. Focus on adapting content for clarity, simplicity, and accuracy, particularly for non-technical audiences. The PoC could target a specific medical topic (e.g., common symptoms or treatments) to ensure feasibility.

2. **Patient information**  
   Develop an LLM application to generate customized patient education materials (e.g., brochures, FAQs). Focus on adapting content to different reading levels, tones, and cultural contexts based on simplified demographic inputs. Use reliable online resources (e.g., helsenorge.no) to ensure accuracy and reduce hallucination risks.

3. **Medical report simplifier**  
   Create an LLM-powered tool that translates complex medical reports (e.g., radiology or pathology reports) into user-friendly language. Allow for varying levels of simplification, such as detailed summaries for clinicians and accessible explanations for patients, incorporating lay definitions of medical terms.

4. **Health guidance**  
   Build a PoC of a health coaching chatbot powered by an LLM to deliver personalized advice and encouragement for patients managing chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease). Focus on simple goal-setting and progress tracking, with optional integration of wearable device data for added functionality.

5. **Streamlining notes**  
   Create an LLM-based tool to summarize lengthy clinical notes, extracting key details like diagnoses, medications, and treatment plans. Tailor the tool to generate concise, task-specific summaries (e.g., discharge summaries, consultation notes) to streamline clinical workflows.

6. **Diagnostic chatbot**  
   Develop a chatbot using an LLM to conduct targeted patient interviews. The chatbot should dynamically adjust its questions based on patient responses and integrate basic medical knowledge to suggest possible differential diagnoses. Focus the PoC on a specific condition (e.g., abdominal pain) to keep the scope manageable.

7. **Speech and LLMs**  
   Design a voice-controlled interface that integrates speech-to-text systems with an LLM for accessing medical information. For the PoC, focus on enabling clinicians to query medical databases or patient records using simple voice commands and natural language responses.

8. **LLM vs. human responses**  
   Design a study comparing AI-generated and human-written responses to common medical queries. The PoC should involve building a dataset of medical questions, generating responses using an LLM, and establishing a framework for evaluating quality, accuracy, and empathy.

9. **Biomedical literature navigator**  
   Develop an LLM-powered tool to assist researchers in navigating and synthesizing biomedical literature. The tool should enable users to ask complex questions, identify relevant papers, and extract key findings. For improved accuracy, consider retrieving Augmented Generation (RAG) or fine-tuning the LLM on a biomedical dataset.

10. **Personalized treatment**  
    Design an LLM-based system that, given a specific condition and patient profile (simplified for the PoC), can query and summarize relevant medical literature to present clinicians with evidence-based, personalized treatment considerations. This could involve techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The focus would be less on making a definitive recommendation and more on aiding clinicians in exploring tailored options.

11. **Patient similarity network explorer**  
    Create a system to build and analyze patient similarity networks using an LLM. The PoC could focus on clustering patients based on simplified characteristics (e.g., demographics, diagnoses) and using the LLM to identify patterns or suggest interventions.

12. **Medical network analyzer**  
    Develop a PoC integrating network analysis techniques with an LLM to interpret complex medical data. For example, analyze comorbidity or drug-drug interaction networks, with the LLM generating insights or identifying patterns from the data structure.

13. **Multimodal diagnostic aid**  
    Build a PoC combining LLMs with image analysis (e.g., pre-trained models) to aid in diagnosis. For example, an LLM could analyze radiology reports alongside medical images to provide comprehensive insights. Alternatively, focus on text-image fusion for diagnosing common skin conditions using public datasets and pre-trained image models.
