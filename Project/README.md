# ELMED219/BMED365: AI in healthcare innovation project

## Overview
Welcome to the course project for ELMED219! This project challenges you to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare through either deep research or hands-on innovation. Working in groups, you'll investigate how AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), can transform medical practice and healthcare delivery.

## Project tracks

The course offers two paths for exploring AI in healthcare. 

### Research track
The Research Track focuses on conducting an in-depth analysis of how AI can address specific healthcare challenges. You'll use AI tools throughout your research process to develop a comprehensive understanding of your chosen topic.

Key elements:
* Thorough investigation of current developments and state-of-the-art
* Critical analysis of potential impacts and implementation challenges
* Extensive use of AI tools for research, analysis, and writing
* Final report demonstrating scholarly rigor and insight
* Research presentation focusing on:

   * Methodology and findings
   * Critical analysis and implications
   * Recommendations for implementation
   * Future research directions

### Innovation track
The Innovation Track takes a hands-on approach by developing a working Proof of Concept (PoC). You'll create a practical solution while experiencing how AI can accelerate healthcare innovation.
Key elements:

* Development of a working prototype
* Creation of a business case
* Use of AI tools throughout development, from ideation to implementation
* Final report documenting technical and business aspects
* Startup pitch presentation including:
   * Problem and solution demonstration
   * Market analysis and value proposition
   * Business model and growth strategy
   * Live prototype demonstration
   * Future development roadmap

This track suits students eager to experience the complete innovation process, from idea to implementation, while learning how AI can transform healthcare entrepreneurship.

## Group formation
Students will work in teams of 3+ people, combining diverse perspectives and skills. We encourage groups to include members with varied backgrounds, as this diversity enriches the project outcomes. While technical expertise is valuable, it's not required for all members - we'll ensure groups have balanced capabilities by distributing students with programming experience across teams.

## Project ideas
Your project can address any healthcare challenge where AI could make a meaningful impact. Some promising areas include patient education materials generation, medical report simplification, diagnostic support systems, and clinical workflow optimization. We encourage you to think creatively about healthcare challenges you've encountered or observed. The course materials provide detailed examples of potential projects, but you're welcome to propose your own ideas within the project framework.

## Deliverables
All groups will produce a comprehensive report documenting their work. For Research Track participants, this includes a detailed analysis of the chosen AI application, its potential impact, and implementation considerations. Innovation Track participants will additionally deliver a working prototype and present their business case to a panel of academic experts and potential stakeholders. Both tracks should incorporate ethical considerations and demonstrate thoughtful use of AI tools throughout the project.

## Possible project ideas
Here are some ideas for inspiration, but students are free to choose their projects within the given framework:

1. **Medical FAQ generator**  
   Build a tool that transforms standard medical FAQs into language tailored for patients. Focus on adapting content for clarity, simplicity, and accuracy, particularly for non-technical audiences. The PoC could target a specific medical topic (e.g., common symptoms or treatments) to ensure feasibility.

2. **Patient information**  
   Develop an LLM application to generate customized patient education materials (e.g., brochures, FAQs). Focus on adapting content to different reading levels, tones, and cultural contexts based on simplified demographic inputs. Use reliable online resources (e.g., helsenorge.no) to ensure accuracy and reduce hallucination risks.

3. **Medical report simplifier**  
   Create an LLM-powered tool that translates complex medical reports (e.g., radiology or pathology reports) into user-friendly language. Allow for varying levels of simplification, such as detailed summaries for clinicians and accessible explanations for patients, incorporating lay definitions of medical terms.

4. **Health guidance**  
   Build a PoC of a health coaching chatbot powered by an LLM to deliver personalized advice and encouragement for patients managing chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease). Focus on simple goal-setting and progress tracking, with optional integration of wearable device data for added functionality.

5. **Streamlining notes**  
   Create an LLM-based tool to summarize lengthy clinical notes, extracting key details like diagnoses, medications, and treatment plans. Tailor the tool to generate concise, task-specific summaries (e.g., discharge summaries, consultation notes) to streamline clinical workflows.

6. **Diagnostic chatbot**  
   Develop a chatbot using an LLM to conduct targeted patient interviews. The chatbot should dynamically adjust its questions based on patient responses and integrate basic medical knowledge to suggest possible differential diagnoses. Focus the PoC on a specific condition (e.g., abdominal pain) to keep the scope manageable.

7. **Speech and LLMs**  
   Design a voice-controlled interface that integrates speech-to-text systems with an LLM for accessing medical information. For the PoC, focus on enabling clinicians to query medical databases or patient records using simple voice commands and natural language responses.

8. **LLM vs. human responses**  
   Design a study comparing AI-generated and human-written responses to common medical queries. The PoC should involve building a dataset of medical questions, generating responses using an LLM, and establishing a framework for evaluating quality, accuracy, and empathy.

9. **Biomedical literature navigator**  
   Develop an LLM-powered tool to assist researchers in navigating and synthesizing biomedical literature. The tool should enable users to ask complex questions, identify relevant papers, and extract key findings. For improved accuracy, consider retrieving Augmented Generation (RAG) or fine-tuning the LLM on a biomedical dataset.

10. **Personalized treatment**  
    Design an LLM-based system that, given a specific condition and patient profile (simplified for the PoC), can query and summarize relevant medical literature to present clinicians with evidence-based, personalized treatment considerations. This could involve techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The focus would be less on making a definitive recommendation and more on aiding clinicians in exploring tailored options.

11. **Patient similarity network explorer**  
    Create a system to build and analyze patient similarity networks using an LLM. The PoC could focus on clustering patients based on simplified characteristics (e.g., demographics, diagnoses) and using the LLM to identify patterns or suggest interventions.

12. **Medical network analyzer**  
    Develop a PoC integrating network analysis techniques with an LLM to interpret complex medical data. For example, analyze comorbidity or drug-drug interaction networks, with the LLM generating insights or identifying patterns from the data structure.

13. **Multimodal diagnostic aid**  
    Build a PoC combining LLMs with image analysis (e.g., pre-trained models) to aid in diagnosis. For example, an LLM could analyze radiology reports alongside medical images to provide comprehensive insights. Alternatively, focus on text-image fusion for diagnosing common skin conditions using public datasets and pre-trained image models.
