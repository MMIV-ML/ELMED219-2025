# ELMED219/BMED365: Course project

## Introduction
This innovation project in ELMED219/BMED365 (2025) focuses on developing a "Proof of Concept" (PoC) for an innovative software solution in medicine/health using artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs). A PoC aims to validate the feasibility of an idea by creating a functional but limited prototype.

## Project goals
The project aims to provide students with experience across the entire innovation process, from idea generation and rapid prototyping to final presentation, all accelerated by AI tools. Students will translate AI solutions into practical and impactful use cases in a medical context while considering technical feasibility and ethical responsibility. In addition to developing a simple "business case" that assesses the solution's potential value, feasibility, and market opportunities, students will also explore the ethical dimensions of AI, including bias, patient privacy, and adherence to medical regulations.

## Possible project ideas
Here are some ideas for inspiration, but students are free to choose their projects within the given framework:

1. **Medical FAQ generator**  
   Build a tool that transforms standard medical FAQs into language tailored for patients. Focus on adapting content for clarity, simplicity, and accuracy, particularly for non-technical audiences. The PoC could target a specific medical topic (e.g., common symptoms or treatments) to ensure feasibility.

2. **Patient information**  
   Develop an LLM application to generate customized patient education materials (e.g., brochures, FAQs). Focus on adapting content to different reading levels, tones, and cultural contexts based on simplified demographic inputs. Use reliable online resources (e.g., helsenorge.no) to ensure accuracy and reduce hallucination risks.

3. **Medical report simplifier**  
   Create an LLM-powered tool that translates complex medical reports (e.g., radiology or pathology reports) into user-friendly language. Allow for varying levels of simplification, such as detailed summaries for clinicians and accessible explanations for patients, incorporating lay definitions of medical terms.

4. **Health guidance**  
   Build a PoC of a health coaching chatbot powered by an LLM to deliver personalized advice and encouragement for patients managing chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease). Focus on simple goal-setting and progress tracking, with optional integration of wearable device data for added functionality.

5. **Streamlining notes**  
   Create an LLM-based tool to summarize lengthy clinical notes, extracting key details like diagnoses, medications, and treatment plans. Tailor the tool to generate concise, task-specific summaries (e.g., discharge summaries, consultation notes) to streamline clinical workflows.

6. **Diagnostic chatbot**  
   Develop a chatbot using an LLM to conduct targeted patient interviews. The chatbot should dynamically adjust its questions based on patient responses and integrate basic medical knowledge to suggest possible differential diagnoses. Focus the PoC on a specific condition (e.g., abdominal pain) to keep the scope manageable.

7. **Speech and LLMs**  
   Design a voice-controlled interface that integrates speech-to-text systems with an LLM for accessing medical information. For the PoC, focus on enabling clinicians to query medical databases or patient records using simple voice commands and natural language responses.

8. **LLM vs. human responses**  
   Design a study comparing AI-generated and human-written responses to common medical queries. The PoC should involve building a dataset of medical questions, generating responses using an LLM, and establishing a framework for evaluating quality, accuracy, and empathy.

9. **Biomedical literature navigator**  
   Develop an LLM-powered tool to assist researchers in navigating and synthesizing biomedical literature. The tool should enable users to ask complex questions, identify relevant papers, and extract key findings. For improved accuracy, consider retrieving Augmented Generation (RAG) or fine-tuning the LLM on a biomedical dataset.

10. **Personalized treatment**  
    Design an LLM-based system that, given a specific condition and patient profile (simplified for the PoC), can query and summarize relevant medical literature to present clinicians with evidence-based, personalized treatment considerations. This could involve techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The focus would be less on making a definitive recommendation and more on aiding clinicians in exploring tailored options.

11. **Patient similarity network explorer**  
    Create a system to build and analyze patient similarity networks using an LLM. The PoC could focus on clustering patients based on simplified characteristics (e.g., demographics, diagnoses) and using the LLM to identify patterns or suggest interventions.

12. **Medical network analyzer**  
    Develop a PoC integrating network analysis techniques with an LLM to interpret complex medical data. For example, analyze comorbidity or drug-drug interaction networks, with the LLM generating insights or identifying patterns from the data structure.

13. **Multimodal diagnostic aid**  
    Build a PoC combining LLMs with image analysis (e.g., pre-trained models) to aid in diagnosis. For example, an LLM could analyze radiology reports alongside medical images to provide comprehensive insights. Alternatively, focus on text-image fusion for diagnosing common skin conditions using public datasets and pre-trained image models.

## Expected outcome
Students will deliver a report describing the project, including a working PoC of the chosen solution and a simple "business case." They will also present their project to a panel of academic experts and potential stakeholders.

## Resources
You will be provided with relevant resources, including access to AI tools, datasets (where applicable), and guidance on developing business cases. Students are encouraged to use online resources such as Overleaf for collaborative report writing using LaTeX. Numerous online resources are available regarding the ethics of AI in healthcare, which may serve as an inspirational starting point.
