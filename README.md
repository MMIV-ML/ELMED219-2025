#### Course overview
[ELMED219](https://www.uib.no/en/course/ELMED219) examines how artificial intelligence and computational tools are shaping modern healthcare. It is offered in collaboration with the [Department of Biomedicine](https://www.uib.no/en/biomedisin) at the University of Bergen (UiB), the [Department of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en/about/management/faculty-of-technology-environmental-and-social-sciences/department-of-computer-science-electrical-engineering-and-mathematical-sciences/) at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL), and the Medical AI group at the [Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization Center](https://mmiv.no) (MMIV).


#### What you will learn
This course provides practical knowledge in computational thinking, medical imaging, and the use of machine learning and AI in healthcare. It also addresses ethical and regulatory challenges, giving students a balanced perspective on innovation in medical AI.

#### Practical applications
Through exercises and demonstrations, participants will work on practical applications, including analyzing MRI data, segmenting medical images, building biomarker prediction models, and exploring concepts like [Patient similarity networks](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11321866) and [multimodal data analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01981-2). The course also introduces large language models ([foundation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_model)) and their potential use in healthcare.

#### Skills and tools
Students will gain experience with Python programming, [Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org), modern AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), and [Claude](https://claude.ai), as well as cloud computing and [AI-assisted coding](https://github.com/resources/articles/ai/ai-coding-tools). Emphasis is placed on open science and reproducible research practices to prepare students for both academic and practical settings.

#### Team project
The course includes a [team project](./Project) where students collaborate to design and build an AI-driven solution to a real healthcare challenge. Teams will take their ideas from concept to prototype and present them as a potential healthcare startup.

#### Why take this course?
ELMED219 is an opportunity to gain valuable skills and insights into the use of AI in medicine and healthcare.

<!--The objective and content of the course address: The computational mindset, imaging, modeling, machine learning, and AI in future medicine, as well as ethical and regulatory aspects of AI. The course is a guided "journey" with a hands-on component through selected computational modeling techniques within biomedical and clinical applications. Examples, demonstrations, and tasks will be related to in vivo imaging (MRI) and segmentation, biomarkers and prediction, [network analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11321866) ("patient similarity networks"), [multimodal data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01981-2), as well as large language models ("[foundation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_model)") within medicine and health. Throughout the course, students will use principles and modern tools for data analysis, machine learning, and generative AI (e.g. [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Claude](https://claude.ai)) within medical applications. The course will give the students an introduction to Python and [Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org), use of [AI-assisted coding](https://github.com/resources/articles/ai/ai-coding-tools), and the "cloud" for access to open data, calculations, and knowledge, as well as insight into and rationale for "open science" and "reproducible research". All course material is openly available on this GitHub repository. (See also [BMED365](https://github.com/MMIV-ML/BMED365))

<!-- - On your own, you are encouraged to spend approximately four hours completing at least one DataCamp course (remember to use the link on MittUiB for free access to DataCamp). Which DataCamp course you're encouraged to do depends on your previous programming experience:<br>
  - No Python programming experience? Complete the course [Introduction to Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)<br>
  - Know some Python, but no machine learning? Complete the course [Supervised Learning with scikit-learn](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn)<br>
  - Know the fundamentals of machine learning in Python? Can you pass the *Machine Learning Fundamentals Assessment*? Complete the course [Biomedical Image Analysis in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/biomedical-image-analysis-in-python)
