# Lab 0: Introduction to theory and tools for machine learning

In this first lab, we'll get an introduction to **machine learning**: what it is and what it's used for. Our approach will be hands-on, using Python and the scikit-learn library.

## Learning objectives

- Define core machine learning concepts and identify appropriate use cases
- Implement and evaluate basic machine learning models using scikit-learn
- Create, modify, and share Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis

## Machine learning in Python
We'll use Python, the most popular programming language for machine learning. The hands-on content is mostly based on [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which lets us mix code, text, results and documentation in a single document. We'll also use the standard data science and machine learning libraries in Python, such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
