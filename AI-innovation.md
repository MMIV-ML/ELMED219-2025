# AI-accelerated innovation

## Session Overview
This session will highlight how modern AI tools can dramatically accelerate the development of innovative healthcare solutions. This session will have a mix of theory and practical demonstration to show you how to move rapidly from idea to prototype. 

# Resources
* [Slides from the lecture, Jan 8th](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/wjwxebe2hs2seuacjipk9/ELMED219-2025-2-AI_Innovation.pdf?rlkey=pvo8jtiv0rfq3gyxc4fhxzoj1&dl=1)

## Learning objectives

By the end of this session, you will:

* Understand how AI tools can accelerate different stages of product development
* See a practical demonstration of building an AI-powered healthcare solution
* Learn strategies for rapid prototyping of AI solutions
* Gain insights for your own project development in the [course project](./Project/)

## Relevance to your course project
This session directly supports your [course project](./Project/), especially if you choose the innovation track where you'll develop and pitch your own AI-powered healthcare solution. You will see ideas how you could approach the development of your solution regardless of the healthcare challenge you chose to solve.

## What you can do next
After this session, you'll be better prepared to:

* Evaluate which healthcare challenges are suitable for AI solutions
* Start developing your own prototype
* Consider the practical aspects of implementing AI in healthcare settings

Donâ€™t forget to bring your questions - the session will include time for discussion about both the technical aspects and practical considerations of implementing AI solutions in healthcare.
